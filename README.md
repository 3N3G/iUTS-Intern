Summary of the two main accomplishments of this internship:
- Creating a IDE (Intersection Delay Estimation) algorithm and supplementing the cycle breaking with an SVM (Support Vector Machine) algorithm
- Researching adversarial methods, implementing a white-box formula based attack analysis and a black-box attack based on Jagielski's work.
